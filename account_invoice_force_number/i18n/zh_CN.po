"    This module allows to force the invoice numbering.\n"
"    It displays the internal_number field. If user fills that field, the "
"typed value will be used as invoice (and move) number. Otherwise, the next "
"sequence sequence number will be retrieved and saved.\n"
"    So, the new field has to be used when user doesn't want to use the "
"default invoice numbering for a specific invoice.\n"
